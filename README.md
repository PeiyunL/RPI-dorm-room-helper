# RPI Dorm Room Helper

## Overview
RPI Dorm Room Helper was born out of a shared frustration with the existing dorm selection process at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Our goal is to build a user-friendly platform that streamlines and improves dorm selection for future RPI students.

The website will integrate:
- Interactive dormitory model displays
- A map-based search interface
- Real-time housing data (if available)

Our vision is to make it easier and more efficient for students to find and choose their ideal dorm rooms for upcoming semesters.

## Semester Goals

We aim to deploy the website online by the end of the semester. Specifically, we plan to:

- ✅ Finish leftover work from the previous semester
- ✅ Add and test unfinished features
- ✅ Conduct thorough testing and debugging
- ✅ Maintain the website after deployment

If time allows:
- ✨ Add a student communication platform
- ✨ Implement 3D models of dorms, including interiors
